<h1>Steve Jobs</h1>
</p><p>In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO,John Sculley</a>. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform</a> development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the visual effects</a> industry by funding the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm</a> that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated</a> feature film <i>Toy Story</a></i> (1995) and became a leading animation studio</a>, producing over 27 films</a> since.
</p><p>In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive</a> to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different</a>" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac</a>, iTunes</a>,Mac OS X</a>, Apple Store</a>, iPod</a>,iTunes Store</a>, iPhone</a>,App Store</a>, and iPad</a>. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor</a>. He died of respiratory arrest</a> related to the tumor in 2011, and in 2022, was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>.
